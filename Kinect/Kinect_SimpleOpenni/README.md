# Kinect V1 and Procesing V3.3.6

In this sketches I'm using SimpleOpenni library to generate different
examples to use Kinect V1.

### You can download directly the SimpleOpenni library from the next repo:

* [SimpleOpenni](https://github.com/totovr/SimpleOpenni)

### Check the next file to setup the Kinect in OSX:

* [Setup_Kinect.md](https://github.com/totovr/SimpleOpenni/tree/Processing_3.3.6)

### This programs are working because of the work of Max Rheiner and his Project:
